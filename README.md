# Final-Year-Project

"The primary objective is to build an automated delivery system based on the industry 4.0 paradigm, with the motivation of helping small businesses and societies. Our long-term goal is to not only use this framework for food delivery in indoor spaces but to also serve society such as helping disabled people, in hospitals for indoor delivery of medicines, etc.".
The code that went behind building this robot can be found in this repository. Moreover, other hardware and design related technicalities can be found in the attached thesis report.
